Self-reflections after talking with Prof about the failure of SIGMOD demo submission
<!--more-->

Our submissions to SIGMOD demo was rejected. However, I felt pretty confidence because we made an add-on that is useful. I was a bit surprised to see the results.

After talking to Prof, I realized the differences between industry demo and research demo. Key difference comes from the **audiences**. 

When researchers review the demo, they not only want to see a tool that is actually working but also mechanism behind it. Our tool without insights is obviously not enough. Based on reviewer's feedback, we add some insights explaining Bayes model probability to make users more confident about the results.
